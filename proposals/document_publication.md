# Document Publication

How do we make RFCs and Internet-Drafts available on the Internet?

- Documenting the different sites and different access mechanisms
- Varying URL constructs across those sites
- SEO and directing people to the authoritative site
- shifting to a single site with a short name (such as docs.ietf.org) for the raw content document types (drafts, RFCs, charters, maybe even email archive messages), making it authoritative, and focusing SEO towards that single site.
